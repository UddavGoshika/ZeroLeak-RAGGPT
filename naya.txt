🌟 Project Proposal: AI Situation Analyzer & Helper with LLMs
________________________________________
🔹 1. Introduction
In the current landscape, AI-powered gadgets primarily function based on text-based inputs or image uploads. They analyze images, recognize objects, and provide answers to user queries. However, these solutions lack real-time situational awareness, which is crucial for individuals who need assistance in navigating new locations or handling emergencies.
🔵 Key Issue: Vulnerable groups such as blind individuals, children, and older people face daily challenges in navigation, safety, and emergency response.
🔴 Impact: Every year, 8-10 million deaths occur due to a lack of timely medical care. This project aims to bridge this gap by providing real-time, AI-powered assistance that proactively analyzes surroundings and takes necessary actions.

🔹 2. Problem Statement
✅ Current AI solutions are limited in their ability to provide real-time, multi-sensory analysis. Most existing assistive technologies rely on user input or manual commands, which can be impractical in critical situations.
❗ Challenges Faced by Users:
•	Blind individuals require guidance in unfamiliar environments.
•	Children need continuous safety monitoring.
•	Elderly individuals may require automated emergency assistance.
🛠️ Our AI-powered system addresses this gap by integrating multiple inputs, including video, audio, location data, and environmental sensors, to provide real-time insights and emergency intervention.
